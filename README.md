Hi! My name is Samantha Perez. I am a senior at Kennesaw State University. 
This repository includes many of my coding assignments and coding projects I 
have completed for fun! I know a couple languages, like Java, which is my 
first language, Python, SQL, C++, and Linux. 

Feel free to contact me through my email sperez_0619@yahoo.com.
